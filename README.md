## Getting Started

Navigate to the directory where you would like to save the project. Run `git clone git@github.com:Monique-K/keep-on-trucking.git`. The app will be downloaded into a folder called `keep-on-trucking`. Go into that folder and run `npm install` to download all dependencies. 

Now you're ready to roll!

Start the API first by navigating to the `trucking/trucking-api` directory and running `npm start`

In a second terminal tab, navigate to `trucking/app` and run `npm start` to start the main app, which will automatically open in a new browser tab.
