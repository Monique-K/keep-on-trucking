KEEP ON TRUCKIN'
===

## Getting Started

First you will want to start your backend server. Instructions can be found at [Keep on Trucking-API](https://github.com/Monique-K/keep-on-trucking-API).

When your backend server is ready, navigate to the directory where you would like to save the project. Run `git clone git@github.com:Monique-K/keep-on-trucking.git`. The app will be downloaded into a folder called `keep-on-trucking`. Go into that folder and run `npm install` to download all dependencies. 

Now you're ready to roll!

Run `npm start` to start the frontend app, which will automatically open in a new browser tab. 

## Description
