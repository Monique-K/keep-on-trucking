## Update Driver Position

Use the form on the right side of the screen to update your driver's position. Note the error messages when incomplete or incorrect information is entered. 

The driver's current position is indicated above the form for quick reference. 

The dropdown menu is cleanly designed to activate on hover, saving the user the need to click to open. It also has a scroll bar inside the options list, so that no matter how many stops you add, the dropdown list will not exceed a certain length on the page. 

## Design

The bold typeface and sharp corners in the app give an industsrial feel, and the colour scheme is reminiscent of a stoplight.

## Technology

This app uses a React frontend and an Express backend.
